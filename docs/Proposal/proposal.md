##### Supervisor: Charlie Daly


##### Project Title: Graphical User Interface for Neural Networks


##### Purpose of Project: Make it easier for novices to design and train Neural Networks.


##### Proposal:
* A web application for the users to interact with – React
	* Sign up/sign in to service.
	* Design model using drag and drop components.
	* Activate training.
	* monitor training.
	* Export model or input to predictor.
* A database to store User’s information.
	* Profile details.
	* Usage.
	* Address for user’s model
* A Python Keras/tensorflow program to create and train the network
	* To create NN.
	* To train NN.
	* To implement NN.
* A Python Backend.
	* REST APIs.
	* To integrate the database with the web applicaiton.
	* To integrate the NN with the web application.


##### Challenges:
* Designing a seamless UX.
* Dynamically designing NN.
* Integrating with AWS.
